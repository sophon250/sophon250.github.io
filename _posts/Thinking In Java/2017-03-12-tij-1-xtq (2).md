##	You manipulate objects with references
	
+	Each programming language has its own means of manipulating elements in memory.
+	每种编程语言都有其自己的操作内存中元素的方法。
+	Are you manipulating the element directly, or are you dealing with some kind of indirect representation (a pointer in C or C++) that must be treated with a special syntax?
+	你是在直接操作元素，或是用一些要用特殊语法对待的非直接的表示
+	Although you treat everything as an object, the identifier you manipulate is actually a “reference” to an object.
+	尽管你将一切当做对象对待，你所操作的实际上是一个对该对象的引用
+	Have a reference doesn’t mean there’s necessarily an object connected to it.
+	有了引用并不意味着一定有一个与其关联的对象 

##	You must create all the objects

*	The keyword *new *says, “Make me a new one of these objects.”
*	 关键字"new"意思是"让我成为这些对象中的一个新的"

###	Where storage lives

*	There are five different places to store data:
*	有五个地方来存储数据：

		1.Registers: registers are allocated as they are needed.	
		//寄存器:寄存器在需要时分配
		2.The Stack: The Java system must know, while it is creating the program, the exact lifetime of all the items that are stored on the stack. Java objects themselves are not placed on the stack.
		//栈: Java系统必须知道，当它创建程序时，所有存储在栈上的对象的生命周期，Java对象本身不在栈中。
		3.The heap:	The compiler doesn’t need to know how long that storage must stay on the heap. Whenever you need an object, you simply write the code to create it by using new, and the storage is allocated on the heap when that code is executed.  
		//堆： 编译器无需知道分配在堆上的内存会存在多久。当你需要一个对象时，你只要写下用new来创建它的代码，当代码执行时内存分配在堆中。
		4.Constant storage: Constant values are often placed directly in the program code.
		//常量池: 常量通常直接放在程序代码中。
		5.Non-RAM storage:If data lives completely outside a program, it can exist while the program is not running, outside the control of the program. The two primary examples of this are Streamed Objects and Persistent Objects.
		//非-RAM存储： 如果数据完全在程序之外生存，它可以在程序未运行时存在，不受程序控制。两个基本例子是流对象和持久化对象。

###	Special case: primitive types

*	 Instead of creating the variable by using new, an “automatic” variable is created that is not a reference.
*	 一个原子变量不是一个引用，不用new来创建
*	 These sizes don’t change from one machine architecture to another as they do in most languages.
*	 不同于大对数语言，这些大小不会从一台机器到另一台机器改变。
*	 All numeric types are signed.
*	 所有的数字类型是有符号的。
*	 The “wrapper” classes for the primitive data types allow you to make a non-primitive object on the heap to represent that primitive type.  
*	 基本数据类型的包装类使得你可以在堆上创建一个非基本类型的对象来代表其基本类型。
*	 Java includes two classes for performing high-precision arithmetic: BigInteger and BigDecimal. Neither one has a primitive analogue.
*	 Java包含两个实现高精度数学计算的类：BigInteger和BigDecimal，它们都没有基本类型。 
*	 You can do anything with a BigInteger or BigDecimal that you can with an int or float, it’s just that you must use method calls instead of operators. 
*	 你可以对BigInteger和BigDecimal做任何可以对int和float做的事，只是你得用方法调用而不是操作符。

###	Arrays in Java

*	If a program accesses the array outside of its memory block or uses the memory before initialization, there will be unpredictable results.
*	如果一个程序在其内存块之外访问数组，或是在初始化之前使用内存，将会得到不可预测的结果。
*	A Java array is guaranteed to be initialized and cannot be accessed outside of its range.
*	Java数组确保了初始化，并且不能在其区间外访问。 
*	When you create an array of objects, you are really creating an array of references, and each of those references is automatically initialized to a special value with its own keyword: null.
*	当你创建一个对象的数组时，实际上创建的是引用的数组，并且这些引用中的每一个都自动初始化为了一个特殊值null.

##	You never need to destroy an object

###	Scoping

*	A variable defined within a scope is available only to the end of that scope.
*	一个域中定义的变量只能在该域结束前使用.
*	The C and C++ ability to “hide” a variable in a larger scope is not allowed in Java.
*	Java中没有c和c++中的将变量隐藏在更大的域中的方法

###	Scope of Objects

*	The references vanishes at the end of the scope. However, the String object that was pointing to is still occupying memory. 
*	引用在域结束时失效，但是其指向的String对象依然占据着内存。
*	Java has a garbage collector, which looks at all the objects that were created with new and figures out which ones are not being referenced anymore. 
*	Java中有GC监视着所有用new创建的对象，并且选出不再被引用的。

##	Creating new data types: class

###	Fields and methods

*	You can put two types of elements in your class: fields ( data members), and methods(member functions).
*	你可以在你的类中放两类元素:字段和方法
*	A field is an object of any type that you can talk to via its reference, or a primitive type.
*	字段是一个可以通过其引用访问的任意类型的对象，或者是一个原始类型。
*	If it is a reference to an object, you must initialize that reference to connect it to an actual object.
*	如果是一个指向对象的引用，你必须将其初始化它让它指向一个实际的对象。

###	Default values for primitive members

*	The default values are only what Java guarantees when the variable is used as a member of a class.
*	Java只保证了一个变量作为一个类成员时的默认值。
*	This ensures that member variables of primitive types will always be initialized.
*	这保证了基本类型的成员变量总是被初始化。
	
##	Methods, arguments, and return values
	
*	Methods in Java determine the messages an object can receive.
*	Java中的方法决定了一个对象可以接收的消息。
*	The method name and argument list ( the signature of the method) uniquely identify that method.
*	方法名和参数列表唯一地标识了一个方法
*	This act of calling a method is commonly referred to as sending a message to an object.
*	这种调用方法的动作通常表示给一个对象发送一条信息
*	What you must specify in the argument list are the types of the objects to pass in and the name to use for each one.
*	在参数列表中须指定的是传入的对象的类型和要使用的名称。 
*	As in any situation in Java where you seem to be handing objects around, you are actually passing references.
*	Java中任何你看似操作对象的情形实际上传递的都是引用。
*	A program is just a bunch of objects with methods that take other objects as arguments and send messages to those other objects. 
*	一个程序其实不过是一串将其他对象作为参数并给它们发送消息的对象。

##	Building a Java program
	
###	Name visibility

*	To produce an unambiguous name for a library, the Java creators want you to use your Internet domain name in reverse since domain names are guaranteed to be unique.
*	为了给一个库起一个清晰的名字，Java创建者希望你用域名倒过来作为名称，因为域名是唯一的。
*	This mechanism means that all of your files automatically live in their own namespaces, and each class within a file must have a unique identifier.
*	这种机制意味着你所有的文件自动在其命名空间内生存，并且文件中的每个类必须有唯一的标识符。

###	Using other components

*	*import* tells the compiler to bring in a package, which is a library of classes.
*	*import*关键字告诉编译器引入一个包，该包是一个类的库。

###	The *static* keywords

*	You want to have only a single piece of storage for a particular field, or you need a method that isn’t associated with any particular object of this class.
*	你只想给某个字段一块单独的内存，或者你需要一个与任何该类的对象不关联的方法。
*	 When you say something is static, it means that particular field or method is not tied to any particular object instance of that class. 
*	 当你说某个东西是static时，意味着某个字段或方法没有与任何特定的类的对象绑定。
*	 Class Data and Class Methods, meaning that the data and methods exist only for the class as a whole, and not for any particular objects of the class. 
*	 类成员和类方法意味着数据和方法只为整个类存在，而不是任何特定对象。
*	 Since static methods don’t need any objects to be created before they are used, they cannot directly access
non-static members or methods by simply calling those other members without referring to a named object.
*	 由于静态方法无需任何对象在它们被使用前创建，它们不能在没有指定一个具体对象的情况下简单地调用它们来直接访问非静态成员或方法。
*	An important use of *static* for methods is to allow you to call that method without creating an object.
*	static方法的一个重要用途是使得你在没有创建对象的情况下来调用该方法。

##	Your first Java program

*	When you’re creating a standalone program such as this one, one of the classes in the file must have the same name as the file.That class must contain a method called main( ).
*	当你创建一个独立的程序时，文件中的一个类必须与文件同名，这个类须有一个main()方法。
*	The args won’t be used in this program, but the Java compiler insists that they be there because they hold the arguments from the command line.
*	Java编译器让args存在的原因是它们持有从命令行输入的参数

##	Comments and embedded documentation

###	Comment documentation

*	Because of Javadoc, you have a straightforward standard for creating documentation, so you can expect or even demand documentation with all Java libraries. 

###	Syntax

*	Javadoc will process comment documentation for only public and protected members.

###	Embedded HTML

*	Javadoc passes HTML commands through to the generated HTML document.
