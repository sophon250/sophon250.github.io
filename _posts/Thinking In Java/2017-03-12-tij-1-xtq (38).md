*	The polymorphic method call allows one type to express its distinction from another, similar type, as long as they’re both derived from the same base type. 
*	多态方法调用使得一个类型可以有别于另一个相似的类型来表达，只要他们继承自相同的基类。

##	Upcasting revisited
*	Taking an object reference and treating it as a reference to its base type is called *upcasting*.
*	将一个对象引用当做其基类的引用来对待称作"上溯造型"。

###	Forgetting the object type
*	The compiler won’t give you any error messages if you forget to overload one of your methods and the whole process of working with types becomes unmanageable.
*	如果你忘记重写一个方法，编译器不会给你任何错误信息，并且用到该类的整个程序都会难以管理。
*	Wouldn’t it be nice if you could forget that there are derived classes, and write your code to talk only to the base class?
*	如果忘记他们是继承类，并只拿基类来写代码岂不美哉? 

##	The twist
###	Method-call binding
*	Connecting a method call to a method body is called binding.
*	将一个方法调用与方法体连接称作绑定。 
*	When binding is performed before the program is run (by the compiler and linker, if there is one), it’s called *early binding*. 
*	若绑定在程序运行前进行(通过编译器和连接器，如果有的话)，称为*早绑定*。
*	*late binding* means that the binding occurs at run time, based on the type of object. 		
*	*晚绑定*意味着绑定发生在运行时，基于对象的类型。
*	There must be some mechanism to determine the type of the object at run time and to call the appropriate method.
*	必须有一些机制来在运行时决定对象类型，并调用合适的方法。
*	All method binding in Java uses late binding unless the method is *static* or *final*(*private* methods are implicitly *final*). 
*	Java中所有的方法绑定都是晚绑定，除非方法是static或final的(*private*方法是隐式final的)
*	Declaring a method *final* effectively “turns off” dynamic binding, or rather it tells the compiler that dynamic binding isn’t necessary. 
*	将一个方法声明为*final*有效地关闭了动态绑定，或者是告诉编译器动态绑定不是必须的。

###	Producing the right behavior
*	Once you know that all method binding in Java happens polymorphically via late binding, you can write your code to talk to the base class and know that all the derived-class cases will work correctly using the same code.
*	一旦你晓得了Java中所有的方法绑定是通过晚绑定多态地发生的，你可以写代码与基类通信，并知道所有继承类的情况均可以用相同的代码正确地工作。

###	Extensibility
*	You can add new functionality by inheriting new data types from the common base class.
*	你可以通过从基类继承新的数据类型增加新功能。
*	Changes in your code don’t cause damage to parts of the program that should not be affected.
*	代码中的改变不会有损于不应被影响的那部分程序。 
*	Polymorphism is an important technique for the programmer to “separate the things that change from the things that stay the same.”  
*	多态是一种重要的让程序员将改变的那部分代码与不变的那部分分离的技术。

###	Pitfall: “overriding” private methods
*	A private method is automatically final, and is also hidden from the derived class.
*	私有方法自动是final的，并且在继承类中隐藏着。
*	Only non-private methods may be overridden.
*	只有非私有方法可以被重写。
*	You should watch out for the appearance of overriding private methods, which generates no compiler warnings.
*	你要注意重写私有方法的出现，它不会造成编译警告。
*	You should use a different name from a private base-class method in your derived class.
*	在继承类中你要用一个不同于私有基类方法的名称。

###	Pitfall: fields and static methods
*	Only ordinary method calls can be polymorphic.
*	只有普通方法调用可以是多态。
*	Any field accesses are resolved by the compiler, and are thus not polymorphic.
*	任何字段访问由编译器解决，因此不是多态的。
*	If a method is static, it doesn’t behave polymorphically.
*	如果一个方法是static 的，它不会表现出多态性。

##	Constructors and polymorphism
*	Constructors are not polymorphic (they’re actually static methods, but the static declaration is implicit).
*	构造函数不是多态的(它们实际上是静态方法，但static声明是隐式的)
*	
###	Order of constructor calls
*	A constructor for the base class is always called during the construction process for a derived class.
*	基类的构造函数总是在继承类的构造期间被调用。
*	The constructor has a special job: to see that the object is built properly.
*	构造函数有一项特殊任务:看对象是不是合适地创建了。
*	Only the base-class constructor has the proper knowledge and access to initialize its own elements.
*	只有基类的构造函数具有合适的信息及访问权限来初始化它自己的元素。
*	It’s essential that all constructors get called; otherwise the entire object wouldn’t be constructed.
*	所有的构造函数都被调用很重要，否则整个对象不会被构造。
*	It will silently call the default constructor if you don’t explicitly call a base-class constructor in the derived-class constructor body.
*	如果在继承类的构造函数中没有显式调用基类的构造函数,它会调用默认构造函数。
*	The order of constructor calls:
*	构造函数的调用顺序:

		1.The base-class constructor is called.
		1.基类构造函数被调用
		2.Member initializers are called.
		2.成员初始化方法被调用
		3.The body of the derived-class constructor is called.
		3.继承类的构造函数体被调用。

*	You must be able to assume that all the members of the base class are valid when you’re in the derived class.
*	在继承类中，你必须能假定基类的所有成员是有效的。
*	Inside the constructor, however, you must be able to assume that all members that you use have been built.
*	然而，在构造函数中你必须能假定用到的所有成员被创建了。 
*	The only way to guarantee this is for the base-class constructor to be called first. Then when you’re in the derived-class constructor, all the members you can access in the base class have been initialized.
*	唯一能保证此的方法是基类的构造函数先执行，然后当你在继承类的构造函数中时，所有你能访问的基类成员都被初始化过了。
*	Whenever possible, you should initialize all member objects at their point of definition in the class.
*	只要有可能，你应当在类中定义它们的位置初始化所有成员对象。

##	Inheritance and cleanup
*	Most of the time you won’t have to worry about cleaning up.
*	大多数时候无需担心清理工作。
*	The order of disposal should be the reverse of the order of initialization, in case one subobject is dependent on another.
*	清理的顺序与初始化相反，以防某一对象依赖于另一对象。
*	This technique(reference counting) requires extra diligence to use, but if you are sharing objects that require cleanup you don’t have much choice.
*	这种方法(引用计数)需要谨慎使用，但如果你在共享一个需要清理的对象你别无选择。

##	Behavior of polymorphic methods inside constructors
*	If you call a dynamically-bound method inside a constructor, the overridden definition for that method is used.
*	如果你在一个构造函数中调用一个动态绑定的方法，使用的是该方法的重写定义。
*	The effect of this call can be rather unexpected because the overridden method will be called before the object is fully constructed.
*	该调用的效果可能出人意料，因为重写方法在对象完全构造完成前会被调用。
*	If the constructor is only one step in building an object of a class that’s been derived from that constructor’s class, the derived parts have not yet been initialized at the time that the current constructor is being called.
*	如果构造函数只是构造一个继承自该构造函数的类的对象的其中一步，继承部分在当前构造函数被调用时还未被初始化。
*	In actual initialization, the storage allocated for the object is initialized to binary zero before anything else happens.
*	在实际的初始化中，对象分配的内存在其他事发生前被初始化为二进制0。
*	Do as little as possible to set the object into a good state, and if you can possibly avoid it, don’t call any other methods in this class.  
*	做尽可能少的事让对象处于好的状态，如果能避免，在该类中不要调用任何其他方法。
*	The only safe methods to call inside a constructor are those that are final in the base class.
*	在构造函数中进行调用的唯一的安全方法是那些基类中的final方法。

##	Covariant return types
*	An overridden method in a derived class can return a type derived from the type returned by the base-class method.
*	继承类中的一个重写方法可以返回一个继承自由基类方法返回的类型的类。

##	Designing with inheritance
*	It’s possible to dynamically choose a type (and thus behavior) when using composition, whereas inheritance requires an exact type to be known at compile time. 
*	使用组合时可以动态地选择一个类型(也可以是行为)，而继承需要一个编译时已知的准确类型。
*	You can’t decide to inherit differently at run time; that must be completely determined at compile time.
*	你不能在运行时决定不同地继承，它必须在编译时完全定下来。
*	Use inheritance to express differences in behavior, and fields to express variations in state.
*	用继承来表达行为的差异，字段来表达状态的变化。

##	Substitution vs. extension
*	*pure substitution*： derived class objects can be perfectly substituted for the base class.
*	*纯替换*:继承类的对象可以完美地替换基类。
*	The base class can receive any message you can send to the derived class because the two have exactly the same interface.
*	基类可以接收任何你可以发给继承类的信息，因为二者具有相同的接口。
*	“*is-like-a*” relationship:	 the derived class is like the base class—it has the same fundamental interface—but it
has other features that require additional methods to implement.
*	"is-like-a"关系:继承类像是基类——它具有相同的基础接口——但它具有需要实现其他方法的特征。
*	The extended part of the interface in the derived class is not available from the base class, so once you upcast, you can’t call the new methods.
*	继承类中接口的扩展部分在基类中无法提供，因此当你上溯造型时，你不能调用新方法。

##	Downcasting and runtime type information
*	With a downcast, you don’t really know that a shape (for example) is actually a circle.
*	用向下转型，你不必知道一个形状(譬如)正好是一个圆。
*	In Java, every cast is checked!
*	Java中，所有转型都被检查了！
*	This act of checking types at run time is called runtime type identification (RTTI).
*	这种运行时检查类型行为叫做运行时类型识别。
*	You can try to downcast. If it’s the correct type, it will be successful. Otherwise, you’ll get a ClassCastException.
*	你可以试着向下转型，如果它是正确的类型，就会成功，否则，你会得到一个ClassCastException。
