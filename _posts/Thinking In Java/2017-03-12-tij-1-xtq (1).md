##	The progress of abstraction

+    But their primary abstraction still requires you to think in terms of the structure of the computer rather than the structure of the problem you are trying to solve.
+    初级的抽象需要你考虑的是计算机的结构，而不是要解决的问题。
+    The alternative to modeling the machine is to model the problem you’re trying to solve.
+    另一种对机器建模的方法是对你所要解决的问题进行建模。 
+    We refer to the elements in the problem space and their representations in the solution space as “objects”.
+    我们将问题空间中的元素及其解决空间中的表示称为对象。
+    When you read the code describing the solution, you’re reading words that also express the problem.
+    描述解决方案的代码也表达了问题。 
+    OOP allows you to describe the problem in terms of the problem, rather than in terms of the computer where the solution will run. 
+    OOP使得你就问题进行描述，而不是解决方案要运行的计算机。
+    Five basic characteristics:
+	 五个基本特征	
	
		1.Everything is an object		
		//一切皆是对象
		2.A program is a bunch of objects telling each other what to do by sending messages. 	
		//程序就是一串通过互相发送信息交流该做撒子	的对象
		3.Each object has its own memory made up of other objects.
		//每个对象都有由其他对象组成的内存 
		4.Every object has a type.
		//所有对象都有其类型
		5.All objects of a particular type can receive the same messages.
		//某个类型的所有对象可以接收同样的信息
+    An object has state, behavior and identity: an object can have internal data (which gives it state), methods (to produce behavior), and each object can be uniquely distinguished from every other object(address in memory).
+    一个对象有状态，行为和标识： 对象可以有内部数据(给其状态)，方法(产生行为)，每个对象可以唯一地区别于其他所有对象(内存中的地址)

##	An object has an interface

+    Objects that are identical except for their state during a program’s execution are grouped together into “classes of objects,” and that’s where the keyword *class* came from.
+    程序运行时，除状态外相同的对象被组织为对象的类，这也是关键字class的由来。
+    Each object belongs to a particular class that defines its characteristics and behaviors.
+    每个对象属于一个特定的定义其特征和行为的类。
+    You extend the programming language by adding new data types specific to your needs.
+    你通过增加新的满足你需求的数据类型来扩展程序语言。 
+    Any program is a simulation of the system you’re designing.
+    程序是对你所设计的系统的模拟。
+    One of the challenges of object-oriented programming is to create a one-to-one mapping between the elements in the problem space and objects in the solution space.
+    OOP的一个难点是创建问题空间中的元素与解决空间中对象的一对一的映射。
+    The requests you can make of an object are defined by its interface, and the type is what determines the interface.	
+    对一个对象的可以发出的请求由其接口定义，接口是由类决定的。
+    A type has a method associated with each possible request, and when you make a particular request to an object, that method is called. 
+    某个类具有与每个可能的请求相关联的方法，当你对一个对象发出一个特定请求时，该方法被调用。

##	An object provides services
	
+    Your program itself will provide services to the user, and it will accomplish this by using the services offered by other objects. 
+    程序对用户提供服务，它通过使用其他对象提供的服务来完成此功能。
+    Thinking of an object as a service provider has an additional benefit: It helps to improve the cohesiveness of the object.
+    将对象想成是服务提供者有另一大好处：可以提升对象的凝聚力
+    In a good object-oriented design, each object does one thing well, but doesn’t try to do too much.
+    在好的面向对象的设计中，每个对象只做好一件事，而不是做许多事。 
+    If they can see the value of the object based on what service it provides, it makes it much easier to fit it into the design.
+    如果可以基于其可以提供的服务来看到对象的价值，就可以更容易地将其融入到设计中。

##	The hidden implementation

+    The goal of the class creator is to build a class that exposes only what’s necessary to the client programmer and keeps everything else hidden.
+    类创建者的目标是建立一个类，只暴漏客户所需要的，而隐藏其他一切。
+    The first reason for access control is to keep client programmers’ hands off portions they shouldn’t touch.
+    需要访问控制的第一个原因是让使用者接触不到他们不需要接触的接口。
+    Parts that are necessary for the internal operation of the data type but not part of the interface that users need in order to solve their particular problems.
+   数据类型内部操作必须的部分，不是使用者解决其特定问题时需要的接口部分。
+    The second reason for access control is to allow the library designer to change the internal workings of the class without worrying about how it will affect the client programmer. 
+    需要访问控制的第二个原因是允许库设计者改变类的内部功能，而无需担心它会如何影响使用者。
		
##	Reusing the implementation

+    Code reuse is one of the greatest advantages that object-oriented programming languages provide.
+    代码重用是OOP语言的最大优势之一。
+    You can also place an object of that class inside a new class. We call this “creating a member object.” this concept is called composition.
+    你可以将一个类的对象放到一个新的类中，这叫做“创建一个成员对象”，这种概念称为组合。
+    You can also change the member objects at run time, to dynamically change the behavior of your program.
+    你也可以在运行时改成员对象，来动态地改变你的程序的行为。
+    You should first look to composition when creating new classes, since it is simpler and more flexible.
+    创建对象时应当先考虑组合，因为组合更简单灵活。
		
##	Inheritance

+    Two types can have characteristics and behaviors in common, but one type may contain more characteristics than another and may also handle more messages.
+    两个类可以有共同的特征和行为，但其中一个可能包含更多的特征以及操作更多信息。
+    This new type contains not only all the members of the existing type (although the private ones are hidden away and
inaccessible), but more importantly it duplicates the interface of the base class. 	
+	给新类型不仅包含已有类型的所有成员(尽管私有部分隐藏了而无法访问),而且更重要的是它复制了基类的接口。
+    Since we know the type of a class by the messages we can send to it, this means that the derived class is the same type as the base class. 
+    由于我们通过可以发送给它的信息来知道某个类的类型，这意味着继承的类和基类是相同的类型。
+    This type equivalence via inheritance is one of the fundamental gateways in understanding the meaning of object-oriented programming.
+    这种通过继承而等价的关系是理解OOP的意义的基础方法之一。
+    You have two ways to differentiate your new derived class from the original base class: Simply add brand new methods to the derived class Or to change the behavior of an existing base-class method.
+    有两种方法来区分继承类和基类：在继承类中增加新方法，或是改变已有基类方法的行为。  

##	Is-a vs. is-like-a relationships

+    A test for inheritance is to determine whether you can state the is-a relationship about the classes and have it make sense.
+    继承的一种测试是判断你是否可以描述类之间的is-a关系，并使其有意义。
+    The new type can still be substituted for the base type, but the substitution isn’t perfect because your new methods are not accessible from the base type.
+    新的类依然可以代替基类，但替代并不完美，因为你的新方法不能被基类访问。
+    The interface of the new object has been extended, and the existing system doesn’t know about anything except the original interface. 
+    新对象的接口被扩展了，已有系统除了原来的接口不会知道其他任何东西。

##	Interchangeable objects with polymorphism

+    When dealing with type hierarchies, you often want to treat an object not as the specific type that it is, but instead as its base type. This allows you to write code that doesn’t depend on specific types.
+    当处理类继承时，你通常不想将一个对象按其类型对待，而是按其基类对待。这世道你可以不按特定类型来写代码。 
+    This ability to easily extend a design by deriving new subtypes is one of the essential ways to encapsulate change.
+    这种可以通过继承新的子类来容易地扩展设计的能力是封装变化的基本方法之一。
+    If a method is going to tell a generic shape to draw itself, the compiler cannot know at compile time precisely what piece of code will be executed. 
+    如果一个方法打算通知一个泛型类来描述他自己，编译器在编译期间就不能精确地知道哪块代码将被执行。
+    When the message is sent, the programmer doesn’t want to know what piece of code will be executed.
+    当消息发送之后，程序员不会想知道哪块代码将被执行
+    The function call generated by a non-OOP compiler causes what is called early binding, It means the compiler generates a call to a specific function name, and the runtime system resolves this call to the absolute address of the code to be executed. 
+    非OOP编译器产生的函数调用形成早绑定，意味着编译器会产生一个对特定函数名的调用，运行时系统将该调用解析为将要运行的代码的绝对地址。
+    Object-oriented languages use the concept of late binding. When you send a message to an object, the code being called isn’t determined until run time. 
+    面向对象语言使用晚绑定的概念，当发送一条信息给一个对象时，被调用的对象直到运行时才决定。
+    The compiler does ensure that the method exists and performs type checking on the arguments and return value, but it doesn’t know the exact code to execute.
+    编译器保证方法的存在，并进行参数的类型检查及返回值，但不知道将被执行的确切代码。
+    In Java, dynamic binding is the default behavior and you don’t need to remember to add any extra keywords in order to get polymorphism.
+    Java中，动态绑定是默认的行为，你不需要增加任何的额外关键字来获得多态。
+    We call this process of treating a derived type as though it were its base type upcasting.
+    这种将一个子类当成其基类来对待的方法称为上滤。

##	The singly rooted hierarchy

+    Whether all classes should ultimately be inherited from a single base class?
+    所有类是否应该继承自一个单独的基类？
+    It turns out that the benefits of the singly rooted hierarchy are many.
+    事实证明单根继承的好处非常多。
+    A singly rooted hierarchy makes it much easier to implement a garbage collector
+    单根继承使得垃圾回收的实现更简单。

##	Containers

+    A container will expand itself whenever necessary to accommodate everything you place inside it.
+    一个容器会扩展自身，当它需要适应放入的所有东西时。 
+    You don’t need to know how many objects you’re going to hold in a container.
+    你无需知道在一个容器中你将放入多少对象。
+    A good OOP language comes with a set of containers as part of the package.
+    好的OOP语言中将一系列容器作为包的一部分。 
+    There are two reasons that you need a choice of containers: First, containers provide different types of interfaces and external behavior.Second, different containers have different efficiencies for certain operations.
+    有两个选择容器的原因：一是容器提供了不同的接口类型及扩展行为，而是不同的容器对特定操作的效率不同。 
+    These and other operations have different efficiencies depending on the underlying structure of the sequence.
+    操作的效率取决于底层序列的结构。 

##	Parameterized types (generics)

+    You cast down the hierarchy to a more specific type.
+    您将层次结构强制转换为更具体的类型。
+    It’s hardly safe to downcast unless you know exactly what you’re dealing with.
+    除非你精确地知道你在处理什么，否则向下转型是不安全的。
+    Wouldn’t it make sense to somehow create the container so that it knows the types that it holds, eliminating the need for the downcast and a possible mistake?
+    一个知道它将容纳的对象的类型，从而消除向下转型和可能的错误的容器不是更有意义吗？
+    A parameterized type is a class that the compiler can automatically customize to work with particular types.
+    参数化类型是一个编译器可以自动将其转换为特定类型的类，

##	Object creation & lifetime

+    Each object requires resources, most notably memory, in order to exist. When an object is no longer needed it must be cleaned up so that these resources are released for reuse.
+    每个对象都需要资源来存在，尤其是内存。当一个对象不再需要时，必须被清除以释放其所占资源。
+    How can you possibly know when to destroy the objects? When you’re done with the object, some other part of the system might not be.
+    你怎么知道啥时候销毁一个对象呢?当你使用完对象后，系统的其他部分未必是这样。
+    The storage and lifetime can be determined while the program is being written in C++.
+    C++中，内存和生命周期可以在写程序时就确定。
+    The second approach is to create objects dynamically in a pool of memory called the heap. In this approach, you don’t know until run time how many objects you need, what their lifetime is, or what their exact type is. Those are determined at the spur of the moment while the program is running.
+    第二个方法是在称作堆的内存池中动态地创建对象，按这种方法，你到运行时才会知道你需要多少对象，它们的生命周期如何，或者它们的准确类型，这些都在程序运行时的一瞬间决定。
+    The amount of time required to allocate storage on the heap can be noticeably longer than the time to create
storage on the stack. 
+	 在堆上进行内存分配所需的时间可能比在栈上长很多。
+    Java uses dynamic memory allocation, exclusively.
+    Java只有动态内存分配。
+    Java provides a feature called a garbage collector that automatically discovers when an object is no longer in use and destroys it. 
+    Java提供了垃圾回收来自动地发现一个对象啥时候不再使用并销毁它。

##	Exception handling: dealing with errors

+    A major problem with most error-handling schemes is that they rely on programmer vigilance in following an agreed-upon convention that is not enforced by the language.
+    大多数错误处理方案的最大问题是依赖于程序员警觉遵守一项非语言强制的公约。
+    An exception is an object that is “thrown” from the site of the error and can be “caught” by an appropriate exception handler designed to handle that particular type of error.
+    异常是一个对象，它在错误发生的地方被抛出来，并且可以被一个合适的设计用来处理该特定类型错误的异常处理器抓住。
+    An exception cannot be ignored, so it’s guaranteed to be dealt with at some point.
+    异常不可以被忽略，因此它必须要在某个点被处理  
+    If you don’t write your code to properly handle exceptions, you’ll get a compile-time error message In Java.
+    Java中，如果不写合适的异常处理代码，会报编译时错误。

##	Concurrent programming

+    Initially, programmers with low-level knowledge of the machine wrote interrupt service routines, and the suspension of the main process was initiated through a hardware interrupt.
+    起初，知道机器底层知识的程序员写中断服务程序，主进程的挂起通过硬件中断来完成。  
+    There’s a large class of problems in which you’re simply trying to partition the problem into separately running pieces (tasks) so that the whole program can be more responsive.
+    当简单地将问题分解成单独运行的片段，从而使整个具有更好的响应时，会有一大堆的问题。
+    One of the convenient features of concurrency at the language level is that the programmer doesn’t need to worry about whether there are many processors or just one.  
+    在语言层面，并发的方便特征之一在于，程序员无需担心是否有多个处理器或是只有一个。
+    If you have more than one task running that’s expecting to access the same resource, you have a problem.
+    当有多个运行的任务想访问同一个资源时，就会有问题。
+    So a task locks a resource, completes its task, and then releases the lock so that someone else can use the resource.
+    一个任务给一个资源上锁，完成其工作，然后释放锁来让其他任务可以使用该资源。

##	Java and the Internet

###	Client/server computing

+    The problems arise because you have a single server trying to serve many clients at once.
+    问题在于只有一台服务器，但要对多个客户端同时提供服务。

###	The Web as a giant server

+    All you care about is connecting to and interacting with one server at a time.
+    你所需要关心的只是在某个时刻连接到一个服务器与其交互。
+    The Web browser was a big step forward: the concept that one piece of information can be displayed on any type of computer without change. 
+    Web浏览器是一大进步：一段信息可以在任何类型的计算机上显示而无需改变
+    The browser was just a viewer it couldn’t perform even the simplest computing tasks.
+    浏览器只是一个显示器，它连最简单的计算工作都不能做。
 
###	Client-side programming

+    This submission passes through the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) provided on all Web servers. The text within the submission tells CGI what to do with it.
+    一次提交通过所有Web服务器都提供的CGI，提交中的文本信息会告诉CGI对它做什么
+     Client-side programming means that the Web browser is harnessed to do whatever work it can, and the result for the user is a much speedier and more interactive experience at your Web site. 
+     客户端编程意味着Web浏览器可以做它可以做的任何工作，给使用者的结果是更快的速度和更具交互性的体验。

**1.Plug-ins**

+    This is a way for a programmer to add new functionality to the browser by downloading a piece of code that plugs itself into the appropriate spot in the browser.
+    这是一个让程序员通过下载一段代码将其插入到浏览器中合适的位置来给浏览器增加新功能的方法
+    The value of the plug-in for client-side programming is that it allows an expert programmer to develop extensions and add those extensions to a browser without the permission of the browser manufacturer.
+    插件对客户端编程的价值在于，它可以让一个牛逼的程序员来研究扩展并将这些扩展添加到浏览器中，而不需要浏览器制造商的允许。 

**2.Scripting languages**

+    Scripting languages tend to be reasonably easy to understand and, because they are simply text that is part of an HTML page, they load very quickly as part of the single server hit required to procure that page.
+    脚本语言很容易理解，因为它们只是部分HTML页面的文本，它们作为获取该页面所需的单个服务器命中的一部分而非常快速地加载。
+    You should probably consider a scripting language before looking at a more involved solution such as Java programming.
+    在找一个更复杂的解决方案之前，你应当尽可能滴考虑使用一种脚本语言，

**3.Java**

+    Java allows client-side programming via the applet and with Java Web Start.
+    Java允许通过applet以及Java Web Start进行客户端编程
+    The applet is downloaded automatically as part of a Web page. When the applet is activated, it executes a program.
+    applet作为Web页面的一部分自动下载，当applet激活时，它运行一个程序。
+    Since Java is a full-fledged programming language, you can do as much work as possible on the client before and after making requests of the server. 
+    由于Java是一门完全成熟的编程语言，你可以在客户端给服务器发送请求前后做尽可能多的工作。

**4.Alternatives**

+    The biggest problem was probably that the 10 MB download necessary to install the JRE was too scary for the average user.
+    最大的问题可能是安装JRE所需下载的10M文件对一般使用者来说太大 
+    Anytime you have control over user machines, for example within a corporation, it is reasonable to distribute and update client applications using these technologies.
+    任何你对用户机器拥有控制权时，例如公司里，有必要用这些技术分布并升级客户端应用。
+    Flex allows you to program without worrying about browser specifics
+    Flex使得你编程时无需担心浏览器类型。

**5.NET and C#**

+    The .NET platform is roughly the same as the JVM and Java libraries, and C# bears unmistakable similarities to Java.
+    .NET平台和Jvm及Java库非常类似，C#与Java明显类似
+    Currently, the main vulnerability and important question concerning .NET is whether Microsoft will allow it to be completely ported to other platforms. 
+    当前，.NET中主要的漏洞和重点关注的问题是微软是否会完全开放其接口给其他平台

**6.Internet vs. intranet**

+    When Web technology is used for an information network that is restricted to a particular company, it is referred to as an intranet.
+    当Web技术用于严格限制在某个特定公司的信息网络时，就称为intranet.
+    If your program is running on the Internet, you don’t know what platform it will be working under, and you want to be extra careful that you don’t disseminate buggy code.
+    如果你的程序运行在Internet上，你不知道它将运行在哪个平台下，你需要非常小心来避免传播有bug的代码
+    If you are involved in such an intranet, the most sensible approach to take is the shortest path that allows you to use your existing code base, rather than trying to recode your programs in a new language.
+    如果你涉及到这样的Intranet,最明智的方法是允许您使用现有代码库的最短路径，而不是尝试以一种新语言来编码。

###	Server-side programming

+    A common scenario involves a request for a complex database search, which the server then formats into an HTML page and sends to you as the result.
+    一个常见的情形涉及对一个数据库查找的请求，服务器将其转为一个HTML页面作为结果发送给你。
+    These database requests must be processed via some code on the server side, which is generally referred to as server-side programming. 
+    这些数据库请求需要通过服务器端的代码来处理，也即是服务器端编程。
+    Java-based Web servers that allow you to perform all your server-side programming in Java by writing what are called servlets. 
+    基于Java的Web服务器允许你通过servlet来实现所有的客户端编程。
+    They eliminate the problems of dealing with differently abled browsers.
+    消除了处理不同浏览器时的问题。
